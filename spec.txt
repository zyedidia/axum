three new CSRs:

MRF (machine register file): holds the address of the current register file.
    If 0, then the rf is not saved/loaded.

MTRF (machine trap register file): holds the value that MRF will be assigned when a trap occurs

MPRF (machine previous register file): holds the value that MRF will be assigned when an mret occurs. Also holds the previous MRF during a trap.

When a trap occurs:
    MPRF <- MRF
    MRF  <- MTRF
When mret is executed:
    MRF <- MPRF


Boot sequence:
MRF  <- 0
MTRF <- &exc_regs
MRF  <- &init_thread.regs
main()

on trap:
if ctx switch:
    MPRF <- &new_thread.regs
