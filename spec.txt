three new CSRs:

MRF (machine register file): holds the address of the current register file, or a special mode:
    [31:2]: address of current register file
    [1:0]: 00 if mode is "addressed rf disabled"
    [1:0]: 01 if mode is "addressed rf enabled"
    [1:0]: 10, 11 are reserved

MTRF (machine trap register file): holds the value that MRF will be assigned when a trap occurs

MPRF (machine previous register file): holds the value that MRF will be assigned when an mret occurs. Also holds the previous MRF during a trap.

When a trap occurs:
    MPRF <- MRF
    MRF  <- MTRF
When mret is executed:
    MRF <- MPRF


Boot sequence:
MRF  <- 0
MTRF <- exc_regs
MRF  <- init_thread.regs
main()

on trap:
if ctx switch:
MPRF <- new_thread.regs
