Architectures:

* 1rf
    * One register file
    * Spill and fill entire register file
* rf-ctx
    * 4 register files (normal, interrupt, syscall, fault)
* rf-cache
    * K register files

Optimizations:

* Lazy spill/fill
    * At register granularity
* Partially lazy spill/fill
    * At caller/callee saved register granularity

Metrics:

* Cycles
    * Interrupt with no context switch
    * Interrupt with context switch
* Power usage
* Area cost
* HDL overhead
